### What I Learned


Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in HTML and CSS, which allowed me to deepen my understanding of responsive design principles, semantic HTML markup, and CSS layout techniques. I refined my ability to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces, implement flexbox and CSS grid for layout, and optimize styles for various screen sizes. This experience enhanced my skills in building modern and accessible web applications while improving my proficiency in front-end development practices.

### Continued development
Moving forward, I plan to focus on expanding my knowledge of JavaScript to enhance interactivity and functionality in my projects. I aim to delve deeper into frameworks like React.js and explore more advanced CSS techniques such as animations and transitions. Additionally, I am eager to learn about best practices in web accessibility and performance optimization to create even more efficient and inclusive websites.
